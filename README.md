# Virtual Library Management System (VLMS)

## Overview
This is the second iteration of our Virtual Library Management System (VLMS) project. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for managing a virtual library, including functionalities for user registration, book browsing, borrowing, returning, and administrative controls.

## User Interface
The user interface (UI) has been developed by the UI team (Michael Beland and Jonathan Jones). In this iteration, we have split the UI code from version 1 into multiple files for better organization and maintainability. This includes multiple .cpp files and corresponding header files.

## Features
- **User Registration**: New users can register and create an account.
- **Login**: Existing users can log in to access their accounts.
- **Book Browsing**: Users can browse the library catalog.
- **Borrowing and Returning**: Users can borrow and return books.
- **Administrative Controls**: Admins can manage the library's catalog, including adding, updating, and removing books.
