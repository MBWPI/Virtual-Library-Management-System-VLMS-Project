# Virtual-Library-Management-System-VLMS-Project

Updated - 6/19/2024

This virtual library management system allows admins to add/remove/update book information, manage users, and manage loaned books. This program also enables users to create accounts, log in to existing accounts, rent books, and view their loaned books. The program does not require an outside server. It is fully operatable within .txt databases. Admins have the choice to use hardcoded admin access or .txt databases.
