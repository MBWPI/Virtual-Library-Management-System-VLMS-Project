Testing on 06/24/2024
Do the username & password functions work?
Yes, they do!

Does the “Add a Book” function work?
Yes, it does!

Does the “Remove a Book” function work?
Yes, it does!

Does the “Update Book Information function work?
Yes, it does! 

Does the “View All Loans” function work?
Yes, it does!

Does the "Add/Remove a User function work?
I don’t think so. Whenever I click on the Add/Remove a User function, it doesn’t add or remove a user; it just says “Managing Users.” So, the Add/Remove user functions do not work properly and do not do what they’re supposed to do. 

Does the logout function work properly?
Yes, it does!

Does the system log in automatically if you input the wrong username or password?
No! The system knows the username & password, recognizes when you input an invalid username or password, & will not log in unless you input the correct username & password. 

Does the register function work? 
Yes it does!2

Does the Exit function work?
It does!
