Virtual Library Management System (VLMS) Project Overview

Objective: Develop a console-based application that simulates the core functionalities of a library management system, enabling operations such as book browsing, borrowing, and returning for users, alongside administrative controls for managing the library's catalog.

Technical Requirements

1.    Version Control: Utilize Git for source code management. The project should be hosted on a platform like GitHub to facilitate collaboration and version tracking.
2.    Testing: Implement unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the system using C++ testing frameworks such as Google Test.
3.    Documentation: Each team member is responsible for documenting their code and contributing to the project report, which will detail the system's design, implementation strategy, testing protocols, and usage instructions.
4.    Data Structures:
o    Book Management: Employ a Binary Search Tree (BST) for storing and efficiently searching for book information.
o    User Management: Use a Hash Map for fast access to user accounts.
o    Checkout Queue: Implement a Queue to manage the FIFO borrowing system.

Project Components and Responsibilities

•    User Interface & Navigation: Design a clear console interface for user interaction, including separate menus for logged-out users, standard users, and administrators.
•    Book Management: Implement functionalities to add, remove, update, and search for books.
•    User Account Management: Create a secure login and registration system, handling user data responsibly.
•    Data Persistence: Ensure the system can save and retrieve library and user data between sessions.

Deliverables
1.    Source Code: Fully documented and managed using Git, including regular commits and meaningful commit messages.
2.    Testing Suite: A set of automated tests for critical functionalities.
3.    Project Report: A comprehensive document covering system design, implementation details, testing strategy, user manual, and team member contributions.

Implementation Notes
•    Security Considerations: While in-depth security practices like password hashing may be beyond this project's scope, emphasize their importance in the documentation.
•    Data Storage: Use simple file handling (e.g., text or JSON files) for storing user and book data. This simplifies the project's complexity while teaching fundamental data management concepts.
•    Role Management: Ensure the system distinguishes between standard users and administrators, granting appropriate access and functionalities based on the user's role.
